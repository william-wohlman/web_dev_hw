      <h3>Some good art tips in general<h3>
        <h4>take breaks often</h4>
          <i>Breathe</i>, drink water, walk around, stretch. Just get up from your artwork
          and take care of yourself. I typically give myself 10 minutes to get away
          from working every 30-40min. It's a healthy habit to get into that will
          keep you from reaching burnout or injuring yourself through stain.<br><br>

        <h4>You will always be a student</h4>
          <i>So don't worry about mastery so much as improvement.</i> I guarantee the artists
          you aspire to be like are always studying and improving. Be satisfied with
          where you are now but stagnate.<br><br>


        <h4>Don't compare your work to others</h4>
          You can only compare your work to what you've done before. Focusing too
          much on how much better or worse others are in comparison to you is not
          only mentally draining, but also a terrible way to breed competition and
          unhealthy thought-processes among your community.<br><br>

          Strive for your own goals. Know that your work and you, has and is valuable.<br><br>

        <h4>Look at others</h4>
          I can almost guarantee that someone has already figured out the process you are
          struggling with. By keeping a list of inspirational artists you admire,
          processes you like, and resources, you make it easier to visualize your
          goals and figure out how to improve.<br><br>

          When looking at these resources, remember to <i>think critically</i> about what you
          like about the piece or artist and why. Then how you can work to incorporate
          it into your toolset.<br><br>

        <h4>Set work aside/ step back from work</h4>
          Sometimes, you need to put a piece aside if it's not working for you.
          That's okay. Work on something else or just go do something else.
          Come back to it later with more energy and fresh eyes.<br><br>

          It is also important to always, always, always step back from your work.
          Literally look at it from farther away. Viewing a piece as a whole will
          often reveal problems or missing information.<br><br>

        <h4>Practice your fundamentals</h4>
          Some advice I've often heard given and practice a lot is to always go back
          to your fundamentals. It's important to come back to them after having
          improved. You're able to see more and often gain more from refining your
          grasp of the fundamentals of art.<br><br>

          Think of your art skills as a building. The fundamentals are the foundation
          of your building, a foundation you can continuously reenforce and that will
          improve nearly every other aspect of your artistic talents.<br><br>

          It can seem dull and boring but if you invest yourself into it, you can
          find enjoyment in it.<br><br>

        <h4>Dont be too invested in your final piece</h4>
          Being too invested in the piece at it's final form has several problems:

          <ul>
            <li><b>Underworking -</b></li>
              <ul>
                <li>You can be too excited to finish a piece and not complete it to the
                best of your ability. This is rare but still happens.</li>
              </ul>
            <p></P>
            <li><b>breeds dissatisfaction -</b></li>
              <ul>
                <li>If you're too invested in the end product of a piece you will often
                be dissatisfied with the process of creating. Instead, find joy in your
                process. the making aspect is 90% of the time you spend with your piece.
                I garentee you will be more satisfied if you find joy in making the art
                rather than looking at the final product.</li>
              </ul>
            <p></p>
            <li><b>keeps you from moving on -</b></li>
              <ul>
                <li>At some point you have to say a piece is done and be done with it. you may
                    not be happy with the final product but that's a repeating reality you'll
                    have to live with as you grow and improve. Knowing when a piece should be
                    called done is an important skill to learn.</li>

                <li>Having a medium amount of quality work is better than having too little
                    work that has been overworked.</li>
              </ul>
            <p></p>
            <li><b>keeps you from letting go/ selling a piece -</b></li>
              <ul>
                <li>One reason I was given for not being too invested in the end result of
                your creative process is that you'll often (and with any luck) be
                selling your work. If you're too invested in your final pieces, it can
                be difficult to let them go or price them appropriately.</li>
              </ul>
          </ul>
        Balance your expectations with your investment and find a happy and
        healthy medium.

        <h4>Always be creating</h4>
        That's it. By always being in a state of creation, you improve. Creation
        doesn't have to be the act of creating work. It can be thinking creatively
        or solving problems.<br><br>

        Even small things you might consider doodles. (I have an issue with the
        word doodle but we'll set that aside for now)<br><br>

        <h4>It's okay to not be doing your best</h4>
        You <b>always</b> put your all into a piece but sometimes you just don't
        have the same creative energy. That is okay. You're not creative a machine.<br><br>

        When this happens, try not to get frustrated and understand that it happens.
        If something isn't working out, just work on some other part of the piece or
        something else altogether It can help you push through.<br><br>

        <h4>It's okay to take breaks</h4>
        If you're feeling stressed, frustrated, or are just unable to work and need
        a break. Take it. You can always come back to the work. I find this is
        often because I haven't been taking breaks or treating myself and my health
        right. So you can take a break and recouperate. Do something else that you
        enjoy. Spend time with people, play games, watch movies, go for a walk, cook
        good food, clean, or in any other way de-stress.<br><br>

        You need balance in your life and that includes mental expendature.<br><br>

        On that note. Have other things you like to do. Don't let art (as much as I
        love it) be the only source of happiness, enjoyment, or fulfillment in
        your life. Curate your interests and have well rounded sources of interest
        and happiness.<br><br>

        <h4>Don't over work</h4>
        Investing too much time or being too obsessive about a piece can often have
        the opposite effect of making it look worse that it would've three hours prior.<br><br>

    <h3>About Me</h3>

    <p>
      I am a Fine Art's student in my senior year here at the University of
      Montana. I was interested in the way that some artists portray themselves
      and their creativity through their gallery sites. I work primarilly
      digitally so this was not a leap for me to invest in.<br><br>

      As a Fine art's student, I have been educated in Figure drawing. As an
      artist, also really love figure drawing and the drawing of animals in
      general. I have learned of and picked up several tools and tips as I have
      kept up my independant studies. The Art Tips section of this site is
      actually personal tennants and observations I have gained through experience.

        Bobby Chiu spearheads <a href="https://www.schoolism.com">Schoolism</a>,
        an online art learning platform, where you enroll in classes offered by
        professional artists. You can learn quite a lot and gain feedback from
        people who've worked professionally for years. I havent had the time or
        money to invest but Chiu's work is amazing and his youtube videos are
        full of insight.<br><br>

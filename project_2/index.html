              A fundamental skill of artists is being able to translate the human figure
              onto a 2D plane accurately and quickly. Figure drawing is different than
              drawing a human figure. It is meant to instill the skills to help you
              communicate a figure on a 2D plane quickly and efficiently.<br>
              <br>
              It needs to be noted that figure drawing involves looking at
              naked individuals for extended periods of time. If this is
              uncomfortable for you or causes an adverse reaction for you, you
              can always find clothed models. This site assumes you are okay
              with human nudity or are growing to become comfortable with it.
              Here is your warning: The contnent is <b>NSFW</b>.<br>
              <br>
              I will not teach you how to figure draw here, for the purposes of this
              assignment. That would take much too long and is often done better in an
              environment where feedback is available.<br>
              <br>
              However, there are great resources out there and if you can, I highly reccomend
              taking a class.<br>
              <br>
              One great aspect of figure drawing is that once you have the basics down,
              you can develop the skills on your own. You just have to look at the
              figure, which you know is accurate, and apply some critical thinking in
              order to understand the issues with your drawing and correct them the
              next time.<br>
              <br>
              I'll share with you some tips and tricks I have learned and some of the basic concepts when starting out.<br>
              <br>
              I'll also share some of the materials I would reccomend when getting started.<br>

              So, first things first, here are a few tools I would reccomend for an
              individual beginging in figure drawing. Keep in mind that these are
              reccomendations and that the tools you use are up to you. The important
              thing is that you are studying the figure and thinking critically.<br>

          <h3><a id="div3">Tips When Starting Out</a></h3>

            alt="check them out!" target="_blank">Constructive Anatomy</a></h6>
          <p>
              <h4>Focus on the form or shapes of the figure</h4>
              Don't worry so much about details. you want to have an accurate
              representation of the figure on the page more than you want to see
              every hair on the head.<br><br>

              In addition, you should not rely on hard line too much. There is an
              imaginary line bordering a part of a human figure and what is not that
              part, sure. But the form of an object is often conveyed best and simplest
              using the transition from light to dark. the gradation of shadow to
              mid-tone to light.<br><br>

              Illustrating this throught hard line is often inefficient and does not
              convey the same mass and weight. That is to say the volume of the object
              and the part of that object where things fall.<br><br>

              If a hard line is appropriate after you have done this, use it.<br>
              <br>
          </p>
          <p>
            <h4>Work monochromatically</h4>

            When just starting out figure drawing, you should limit the information you
            are trying to convey. So working in a monochromatic color scheme is best.<br>
            <br>
          </p>
        <p>

          <h4>Know and practice your fundemental art skills</h4>

              Proportion, perspective, basic human anatom.<br><br>

              Setting up still lives and working from those is always a good idea
              when starting out. this helps you solidify your foundational artistic
              principals.<br><br>

              When setting up yor still lives , you want objects to move back into
              space, be at strange angles, and incorporate objects that are a little weird
              or you feel will challenge yourself. I know it can seem boring but it is an
              important step to getting these fundamentals down using simpler shapes.<br><br>

              This is a good series to start with when studying the basics of anatomy<br><br>

          <p>
            <h4>Keep yourself timed</h4>

              Don't skimp out on this. you're trying to illustrate the human figure
              quickly and accurately. by setting a time limit and only focusing on
              what is necissary, you train your eye to pick out only the most
              important information to convey.<br><br>
          </p>
          <p>
            <h4>Don't work from magazines or comics</h4>

            Not that these mediums arent fun, but they are often not realistic.
            Prioritizing design or the ideal and taking artistic liberties when it
            comes to anatomy.<br><br>

            Learn the rules before you break them. Drawing from life will help you
            know how to illustrate the shape of a human. Once you know that,
            then extrapolate.<br><br>
          </p>
          <p>
            <h4>If you can, always work larger.</h4>
            It helps you to think in a different scale and to focus on large areas of
            shadow and light. You are also able to fanagle a bit more with the
            information on the page. It can be daunting at first but larger areas allow
            you to expand across the plane freely.<br><br>

            At this point, it would be good to check out the stuff in the
            <a href="./sub_page/video.html">Resources</a> tab.

          <h3><a id="div4">Things to remember</a></h3>
            <p><h4>Ground The Figure</h4>
                Most importantly, place accurate shadow on the plane where your figure
                stands. otherwise they'll be floating in a void of nothing.<br>

              <h4>The Environment and The Figure</h4>
              be sure to pay attention to how the sitter and therefore your figure
                interacts with the environment around them. how do their feet plant on the
                ground, what happens when the sole meets the hard plane of the floor or the
                palm meets a wall or chair.<br>

              <h4>Don't Draw Everything</h4>
                if a single line will do to illustrate the point, use a single line.
                Learn line literacy and how to express volume with a line. curved lines,
                lines that go from thin to thick, and vice versa are all ways of accurately
                depicting the volume and weight of a figure.<br>

                In addition, when you do use detail, don't detail all over. detail creates a
                focal point so be aware that any detail you use will draw the eye of the
                viewer to that spot.<br>

                That detail must also be contrasted with the vague. Smudge, smear, lighten,
                erase, or thin lines to convey a sense of mystery to that part of the piece.
                emphasizing the focal point.<br>

              <h4>Treat the sides of your forms differently</h4>
                To add to the feeling of volume in a form, don't treat both sides of it the
                same. differ line weight and or value to emphasize the change from one side
                to another and pull the eye around. this also adds to the interest of the
                piece without becoming too detailed.<br>

              <h4>Smudge, Drag, and Erase</h4>
                Don't be afraid to smudge, drag, or erase the lines or shapes of your drawing
                There are many ways that these techniques can add to the drawing.
                Smudging or dragging a shape or line can make it vague or create a gradient
                for the shadow. (when doing this, don't forget to consult the different
                parts of a shadow as well as what is on the figure in order to accurately
                depict it)<br>

                Erasing can create a bit of mid-tone or light and help break a line or
                make it illustrate volume. Never be to attached to the drawing to erase.<br>

                <h4>Words of Wisdom</h4>
                Finally, as Mary Anne Bonjourni, my Drawing 1 - Figure Drawing course instructor has often said: "<b>DON'T OVER WORK IT</b>"

    <h1>Header 1</h1>

    <h6>Header 6 is the max</h>
    <!--By default, browsers will display headings with decreasing font size,
    although headings should instead be explicitly styled using CSS rules and
    definitions. This prevents any un-expected rendering of the web document
    content.-->

    <p>Paragraph 1</p>

    <pre>
      You can use the preformatted text element (<pre>...</pre>)
        - tell a browser to render spaces and text exactly as you’ve typed.

      This tag usually displays the contents of the element in a fixed-width
      font, as it is primarily used for preformatted code. However, it can also
      be used for preformatted text.
    </pre>

    <br />
      <!--this is a line break. It is catagorized as an empty element-->
      <!--An ‘empty element’ only has one tag.
      Before the closing bracket of an empty element there
      will often be a space and a forward-slash ( / ) character.
      It is a good habit to get into writing these tags in this way.-->
      <!-- line breaks can be placed inside of paragraphs as well -->

    <hr />
      <!--this is a horizontal rule. It is a line that
      runs across a browser window.-->
